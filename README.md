- Python Libraries(Matplotlib, Seaborn) - Data Analysis and Visualization

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed. the following tasks:

1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.
4. Data Wrangling

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall Hotels Bookings Cancellattion trend?
- Which Hotels has high cancellation?
- Which years are the peak periods when cancellation was high?

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing the high cancellation of hotels over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the few months.
2. City Hotels are the peak in high cancellation.
3. Customer segments with Average Daily Rate (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.
4. Countries like Portugal has around **70%** cancellation of hotel bookings among overall countries.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Analyzing the impact of average daily rate (ADR) on hotel booking cancellations: This study investigates how ADR increases influence cancellation rates, aiming to optimize revenue strategies in the hospitality industry.
- Invest in marketing and promotions during months when client engagement is typically low.
- Countries like Portugal has high cancellation rates, We'll have to explore why this country has high cancellation and which factors are affecting it.
